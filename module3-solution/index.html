                    Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                     Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them
                     in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs,
                     chickens have become prevalent throughout the
                    cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has
                    been variously adapted to regional tastes.
                    Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, 
                    usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of 
                    ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles
                     of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
                      ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi. 
                      Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on 
                      economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. 
                      The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, 
                      is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the 
                      United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam
                       free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens
                        as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or 
                        concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually 
                        fed a ration of grain, 
                      protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.
